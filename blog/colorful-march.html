        <article class="blogpost__main">
          <h1 class="blogpost__title">Colorful March</h1>
          <p class="blogpost__date">3 April 2023</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">This March turned out to be really colorful. There were created illustrations about ordinary life and about Belarus, of course.</p>

          <h2 class="blogpost__subheading">Lights</h2>
          <p class="blogpost__par">About people who glow and illuminate everything around.</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">In endless thinking about the meaning of life I came across the idea of "being a light". There are people who do good not on purpose but as a natural extension of who they are. There are many such people. And it would be great if there were even more lights so that walking through this life would be more beautiful, brighter and happier for us all.</p>
          <img src="../img/blogposts/colorful-march/blogpost-colorful-march-1.jpg" alt=" " class="blogpost__img">

          <h2 class="blogpost__subheading">Storks</h2>
          <p class="blogpost__par">Storks are a symbol of Belarus, although they live not only in its territory. As well as Belarusians.</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">Many people left the country, where there is more and more repression and it is more and more difficult to live. But the people who left also continue to do something for the benefit of Belarus (not for the benefit of the Belarusian regime). And some Belarusians are really becoming symbols for the whole country. Like storks.</p>
          <img src="../img/blogposts/colorful-march/blogpost-colorful-march-2.jpg" alt=" " class="blogpost__img">

          <h2 class="blogpost__subheading">Literature</h2>
          <p class="blogpost__par">A way of personal Belarusization.</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">I am one of those who have started speaking their own language in the last year. And the further the more I feel the need to develop it. There are various initiatives for this, and there is also literature. After school I wasn't particularly interested in it, but now I'm interested in everything created in Belarusian. And with every book I read I expand not only the language but also the knowledge and the feeling of being a Belarusian. So this is a way of personal Belarusization.</p>

          <h2 class="blogpost__subheading">Comparison</h2>
          <p class="blogpost__par">- Do not compare yourself with others!<br>- Yeah...</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">This is about comparing yourself with others and that you need to compare yourself with yourself. But when there’re only “skyscrapers” around it’s tough.</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">This illustration was inspired by the view from my window. Not only by him, of course, but also by thinking about creativity and the Internet. You can see a lot of beauty on the Internet. And the question constantly arises whether it really makes sense for me to create, because many people do it better, in my opinion. But probably I, like all of us, will be somewhere in the middle: someone is just starting his creative journey and someone is already far ahead. So that's okay.  It's even good to remember that I'm somewhere in the middle. It gives humility which I think is good for a person, for me. The main thing is that this comparison does not prevent at least some forward movement. Because in order to come forward, get better you have to make some steps.</p>

          <h2 class="blogpost__subheading">End house</h2>
          <p class="blogpost__par">“If my house is on the edge, it means that I am the first to meet the enemy”.</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">This proverb comes from Ukrainians. Another meaning of this proverb’s first part is more common in Belarus. In Belarus "my house is on the edge" is about the fact that the person in this house is not going to get involved in what’s happening around, he’s going to continue to live his personal life and that’s it. But history shows more and more that it is impossible to be "not in politics", because we are all in politics. And when the enemy comes we must meet him otherwise he can destroy us like many peaceful Ukrainians... But brave people set an inspiring example. Maybe we, Belarusians, will become more courageous to protect our home which we will really own. Now I just gather wisdom from our neighbors for the future.</p>

          <h2 class="blogpost__subheading">Generations</h2>
          <p class="blogpost__par">Different generations and one hope.</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">I created this illustration for Freedom Day, which we celebrate on March 25. We have been celebrating it for 105 years, and Belarus has existed as a state for 105 years although usually under some kind of occupation. Different generations come, and they all dream of a free and happy Belarus. But if this hope is passed from generation to generation the confidence that one day it will happen grows stronger.</p>
          <img src="../img/blogposts/colorful-march/blogpost-colorful-march-6.jpg" alt=" " class="blogpost__img">

          <h2 class="blogpost__subheading">Bouquet</h2>
          <p class="blogpost__par">There are as many flowers as there are political prisoners in Belarus.</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">There are 1467 flowers in the illustration. So many people were recognized as political prisoners on the day when I was making the sketch. It is clear that many more people suffer from unjust punishment. And time goes on but the number of political prisoners increases. Even from this we can conclude that everything in Belarus is not only consistently bad but is getting worse.</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">I've already drawn similar pictures with the number of political prisoners in 2021 and 2022. I drew a crowd of people, then silhouettes in the windows. And now the number of political prisoners is so large that neither faces nor silhouettes will be visible. That's why I thought about a bouquet. And when I thought about which flowers to draw I chose cornflowers and daisies because these flowers grow in Belarus without any particular human care. These are free flowers. And political prisoners are free people. But they are now in the hands of the regime.</p>

          <p class="blogpost__par">&#9472;</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">I don't want to end this blogpost on the last illustration’s painful topic. I just draw what seems to be the most relevant of all my ideas at the moment. So these illustrations are happened to be created during March.</p>
          <p class="blogpost__par">I hope something good awaits us in the future. And good pictures as well.</p>
